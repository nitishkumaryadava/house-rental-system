# room-rental-system-JAVA
A simple student room rental system / OOP with JAVA


## assignment description

> Students often look for a place to live during their studies. We want to create a system to store these properties. 

There are only two types of properties for this system: An apartment or studenthouse. All properties in the system have an address (which can be stored in just one string) and a unique number, starting with 1 and automatically incrementing when a property is added.
For studenthouses a list of student rooms will be kept. Every student room has a number, a name of the student who lives in it and a rental price for the room. The number will not be autogenerated, but needs to be given when you add a room to the system. The rooms will normally be added by reading a JSON file. Two JSON files are supplied.
The last thing you should add is a feature to get the studenthouse with the largest revenue. The revenue is the sum of all room rental prices.

> Please note: You don’t have to make a menu or other user interfaces for the system.


## Example outout

Output of the system looks like this:
```text
Overview of all properties

Room 2 rented to Andrew Tanenbaum with price 600

The student house with the largest revenue is:

Room 1 rented to James Gosling with price 500
Room 2 rented to Bill Gates with price 900
